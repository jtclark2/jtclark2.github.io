							<p>Bringing a little hardware into it... Here are a few mechatronics projects I've built.</p>

							<p>
								I built this with a friend back in 2013. We sourced and assembled the drone ourselves.
								The body is carbon fibre with aluminum motor mounts. We used the open source
								multiWii software with an arduino. This code is tuned for a specific kit frame, but can
								be re-tuned with some understanding of PID controllers. It is a little tricky, since you
								have a PID loop for each axis...we definitely crashed and went through some spare parts
								while working that out. Also, warning to anybody who wants to build one of these, make
								sure you're max throttle never exceeds the capacity of any individual motor. The drone
								will lose stability catastrophically, and it's a bug that only shows up when you start
								flying aggressively.
							</p>
							<p>
								The drone was very fun to fly. With a 5000mAh 3S, we could get around 35minutes of flight,
								or carry a payload up to 4 lbs for about 15 minutes.

							<h3>Arcade Style - Wallace and Gromet Scene (Final Project for 218A) </h3>

								This was our final project for Stanford's ME218A : Smart Product Design Fundamentals.
								This is the first in a series of a mechatronics courses. This project was a way for us
								all to get comfortable integrating basic circuit design, mechanical design, and firmware.
							</p>
							<p>
								The project is an interactive game, based on "Wallace and Gromit: A Grand Day Out". The
								game indicates it is ready for play by opening the launch bay to reveal our space ship.
								Start the launch sequence by lighting the fuse, represented by the red LEDs. Before the
								fuse burns down and time runs out, prepare your ship for a journey to the moon, by
								completing challenges! Fuel up by loading enough crackers for your picnic on the moon.
								Then heat up your engines, stoking the flames by blowing on the fan!

							<h3>Autonomous Tank (Final Project for 218B)</h3>

							<p>This was my first autonomous robot! We had ~3 weeks to build and program this. It was the
								final project in the second course of our mecatronics series (ME 218). The objective was
								to knock down the towers in the order specified by a central commander. The bot queries
								the commander remotely to request the next target. Each time another target is disabled,
								the bit queries the target commander for the next object, which it will randomly select.
								At the end of the run, the robot navigates back to home, within the red tape.</p>
							<p>How does the bot locate itself and it's targets?
								Sensors:
								<ul>
									<li>Tape Following: There are brightness sensors on the bottom of the bot.</li>
									<li>IR Sensors: When a tower is activated, it also illuminates an IR emitter.</li>
									<li>Wheel Encoders: We used dead-reckoning in between sensor readings. The bot had
										a hardcoded map of all the target locations, and the
										location it intended to fire nerf balls from.</li>
									<li>Cannon Encoder / PID: The main nerf cannon was a wheel that spun up to shoot nerf
										balls. We printed a circle with striped spokes, and glue it to the side of the
										wheel to use as an encoder, which actually worked pretty well. We controlled the
										wheel/projectile velocity with a PID algorithm.
									</li>
								</ul>
								The bot used dead reckoning and tape following to make it's way to the 'T' at the end of
								the tape. Then it queries the commander and starts rotating to find targets. We were
								definitely stretching the precision of all the sensors we were using, but we managed to
								get it all working.</p>
							<p>Our team consisted of three people. I focused on the firmware, while the other two
								focused on hardware and electronics. Of course, we all chipped in wherever we could.</p>
							<p>Around the 40 second mark in the video, the commander fails to register that one of the
								towers is disabled. It's been a while, but I think our bot was confident enough that it
								sent an override requesting the commander to advance to the next target.</p>

							<!--NOT INCLUDING: AFTER REVIEWING THIS PROJECT, I'M JUST NOT PROUD OF IT...IT KIND OF SUCKED-->
							<!--AND IF I'M BEING HONEST, I WAS A WEAK LINK ON THIS TEAM. SO LET'S NOT SHOWCASE ONE OF MY -->
							<!--WORST PROJECTS EVER.-->
							<!--<h3>Remote Control Boat (Final Project for 218C)</h3>-->
							<!--<p>-->
								<!--For this project, each group had to  design a "fishing vessel" to compete in "An Even-->
								<!--Deadlier Catch", a game in which teams race to collect fish from digital crabbing pots-->
								<!--distributed around the field (the Terman Pond). Each group pilots their "fishing vessel"-->
								<!--to collect crabs as quickly as they can, and return to the docks to unload. Meanwhile,-->
								<!--vessels can "waterlog" each other by soaking a sensor in the big funnel. This causes-->
								<!--any crabs to be lost, and the vessel needs to return to dry-dock for repairs before-->
								<!--continuing play.-->
							<!--</p>-->
							<!--<p>-->
								<!--<b>Communication</b>: Admittedly, this boat is not much of a looker, but that's because the important bits are-->
								<!--all in the communication, which was a heavy focus of this course. "Neptune, the God of-->
								<!--the Seas", communicates with a Xbee24 radio, telling the pilots how much crab is available-->
								<!--in each pot. Similarly, communication between the control and the boat was handled with-->
								<!--the Xbee controller. Each of the locations, crab pots and docks, were equipped with-->
								<!--RFID tags, which we could communicate with at a range of about 3-4 inches.-->
							<!--</p>-->
							<!--<p>-->
								<!--<b>The Boat</b> was propeller driven, and obviously the electronics were fully sealed.-->
								<!--The water gun is a pump that fires water out of the mouth. The collapsing wings-->
								<!--on the port side indicate how much crab the boat is currently holding. The funnel was-->
								<!--the mandatory "waterlog" sensor, which forced a return to the dock.-->
							<!--</p>-->
							<!--<p><b>The controller</b> was a laser cut Kraken, with LCD</p>-->
