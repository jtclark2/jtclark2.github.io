							<p>Bringing a little hardware into it... Here are a few mechatronics projects I've built.</p>
							<h3>Quadcopter</h3>

							<p>I built this with a friend back in 2013. This was our first semi-stable flight. It
								definitely wasn't as stable as modern quadcopers, and we were still tuning parameters.
								It was the middle of the night, and I hope we didn't wake the neighors (it sounds like
								1000 swarms of bees). We had been working/testing inside all day though, and we just
								had to get one test flight out!

							<h3>Autonomous Tank</h3>

							<p>This was my first autonomous robot! We had ~3 weeks to build and program this. It was the
								final project in the second course of our mecatronics series (ME 218). The objective was
								to knock down the towers in the order specified by a central commander. The bot queries
								the commander remotely to check on targets, and each time one is disabled, it randomly
								selects a new target. At the end of the run, the robot navigates back to hom, within
								the red tape.</p>
							<p>How does the bot locate itself and it's targets?
								Sensors:
								<ul>
									<li>Tape Following: There are brightness sensors on the bottom of the bot.</li>
									<li>IR Sensors: When a tower is activated, it also illuminates an IR emitter.</li>
									<li>Wheel Encoders: We used dead-reckoning in between sensor readings. The bot had
										a hardcoded map of all the target locations, and the
										location it intended to fire nerf balls from.</li>
									<li>Cannon Encoder / PID: The main nerf cannon was a wheel that spun up to shoot nerf
										balls. We printed a circle with striped spokes, and glue it to the side of the
										wheel to use as an encoder, which actually worked pretty well. We controlled the
										wheel/projectile velocity with a PID algorithm.
									</li>
								</ul>
								The bot used dead reckoning and tape following to make it's way to the 'T' at the end of
								the tape. Then it queries the commander and starts rotating to find targets. We were
								definitely stretching the precision of all the sensors we were using, but we managed to
								get it all working.</p>
							<p>Our team consisted of three people. I focused on the firmware, while the other two
								focused on hardware and electronics. Of course, we all chipped in wherever we could.</p>
							<p>Around the 40 second mark in the video, the commander fails to register that one of the
								towers is disabled. It's been a while, but I think our bot was confident enough that it
								sent an override requesting the commander to advance to the next target.</p>

							<h3>eBeam Glove</h3>

							<p>This glove was made when I was working in a rapid-prototyping and user-testing team at
								Luidia, making interactive whiteboards. I put this prototype together in ~3 days.
								I used the part of a stylus that Luidia made to locate the finger on the screen. I added
								flex sensors to the fingers and aluminum tape to the palm for gesture sensing. I
								believe the extra functionality was enabled by a python script in the background that
								was sending mouse movement / clicks / etc.
							</p>
							<p>We knew our clients wanted the hover functionality, and this glove was one of many
								form-factors we considered. This prototype was definitely built to
								demonstrate functionality, not looks. However, there was a lot of excitement when I
								shared it, and I think the marketing team spun it to showing how cutting-edge we were.
