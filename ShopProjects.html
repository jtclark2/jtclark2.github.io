								<figcaption><i> - This was a project for ME310, focusing on rapid prototyping and
									user centric design, in order to find solutions to problems that fit diverse users.
									We partnered with Belcorp/Esika to "Reinvent makeup for the latin american woman."
									The real strength of this design was the concept, which was refined through many
									iterations of prototyping, testing, and discussion with women in both the United States
									and Colombia. Many of the styles at the time were quite advanced, and difficulty
									to apply well. A well blended shadow takes time and practice. Many women don't
									even use liquid eye-shadow, because of the difficulty and precision required, and
									how frustrating it is if you make a mistake. The applicators make it easy. We
									literally had people with no make-up experience putting on liquid eye-liner in
									less than a minute. There
