							<h1 class="major">Mars: Spectral Analysis, Denoising, and Landing Site Selection</h1>
							<h2>The Mission and The Team</h2>
							<p>Real quick, let's get through the acronym soup...From 2007 - 2009, I worked with
								SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligent) /
								NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) on the
								CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) team. CRISM is a hyperspectral camera on
								MRO (the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), a satellite orbiting Mars.
								My mentors were Janice Bishop, the I and Mario Parente a statistician and
								<b>(look up and link their bios).</b>
								I started my work data processing pipeline and simulation team, a hyperspectral  - Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars
							</p>
							<img src="images/???" alt="Pull a picture of the orbiter, with the camera diagram - NASA made some good graphics" />
							<p>
								Our team was interested in a few things. Our explicit mission was to study the geology and climate
								or Mars, and provide Reconnaissance to select future landing sites. In other words, learn as
								much as we could about Mars, and figure out the most interesting spots to land future rovers.
								Interesting spots were usually dictated by the minerals that were present, particularly
								minerals that only form in the presence of water. Nobody at SETI actually thinks there
								is life on Mars, but it is the only other planet that is both close enough to study, and
								which may have had the appropriate conditions for life (as we know it) to form. We searched
								for hydrated mineralolgy, which would suggest the presence of water, or rather a history
								of water being present some time in the last few billion years.
							</p>

							<p>Additionally, we were interested in the scientific discoveries made along the way. The team
								published a lot of work in planetary geology, chemistry, and remote sensing. The remote
								sensing was my focus. I published on the data analysis pipeline, denoising methods,
								and simulation tools. I even joined in a bit of the chemistry, presenting one poster on
								spectral signatures for different mineral mixtures and grain sizes.
								<b>I need to look up those papers</b>
							</p>

							<h2>My Contributions</h2>
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>First off, a little background about hyperspectral data. Most images that you look at are
								either grayscale (1 color channel), or RGB (3 color channels). CRISM takes hyperspectral
								data in 544 channels, make the color dimension very rich. Just using red, green, and blue,
								we can distinguish between all sorts of things. If you see in 544 colors, you can learn
								a lot. In fact, you can often tell what kind of minerals are present, and sometimes
								even determine the grain sizes of dirt, and the amount of water that was present when
								the minerals formed. With so many color channels, it was helpful to think of the data in
								3D (height, width, channel), and we refers to hyperspectral images as data cubes.
								</p>
							<img src="images/???" alt="Add a datacube picture"/>
							<h3>Atmosphere and Noise</h3>
							<p>I spent my first summer with the team as an intern / student researcher, modeling Martian
								atmosphere. We want to focus on the surface of the planet, so we factored out the atmosphere
								and the spectral contributions of our light source, the sun. Around the time I graduated, I was invited to help the team further. In particular,
								we needed to improve the image processing pipeline to deal with the failure of a critical
								cooling system on MRO. The cooler failure resulted in equipment running much hotter than
								intended, and introducing lots of different types of noise into our data. Mario and I
								were put in charge of de-noising the images. We did a lot of work breaking down the hyperspectral
								data cubes and finding statistically relevant ways to remove noise in 3D. In fact, we
								did so well that there was initially some doubt about whether we had smoothed out too much
								of the real information as well. We hadn't, but it would take us a long time to prove it...
							</p>
							<img src="images/???" alt="Pull a noisy pic and a result pic from our paper"/>
							<h3>Analysis</h3>
							<p>The second part of our work was analyzing the results, and writing filters to determine
							what minerals were present. Some of these were manual, mostly ratios of different channels
								that indicate the presence of certain minerals. More advanced models used machine learning
							techniques to help reduce the dimensionality of data, and cluster it into different mineral
							groups. We would often study pure minerals (called endmembers), as well as minerals in different abundances. Then
							we would analyze the images, trying to determine how much of each mineral had contributed
							to create the spectral signatures we saw.</p>
							<img src="images/???" alt="Show pretty pictures - they don't even need to be from the paper. I can find these online"/>

							<h3>Simulation</h3>
							<p>Mars is far away (obviously). When we believed we had detected minerals, we had
								no way to verify it. There was no way to get ground truth or labels for our data.
								There was no way to assess the quality of our results. So we built a way! Starting with
								spectral signatures found in the lab, we simulated high resolution maps (80GB) of Mars-like
								terrain. Then we generated fractal elevation maps, applied realistic lighting, and atmosphere
								contributions. Then we simulated CRISM, taking into account the responsiveness to various wavelengths,
								as well as various types of noise that we had been able to isolate and explain (largely due to
								temperature dependencies in the sensors. I knew we had done well, when our Principal Investigator
								walked by one day, saw one of our simulations, and asked what region we were mapping.
							</p>
							<img src="images/???" alt="Pull pics from the paper if I have them...don't specifically remember these"/>

							<h3>Validation</h3>
							<p>The model was exceptionally realistic, and once we had it, we knew the ground truth of
								pseudo-Martian terrain. We used that to proving that our denoising tools were accurately
								removing noise, and inferring the real information. Some of our denoised data had looked
								a little too good, and this data finally allowed us to verify that we were in fact recovering
								real data, rather than just smoothing away signal along with the noise. We were also able
								to start validating our analysis, and showing how good various detection tools were. This
								work was quite solid, and we won best paper at the very first IEEE WHISPERS
								(Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing) conference.
