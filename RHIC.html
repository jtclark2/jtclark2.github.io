                                In 2006, I spent my summer working with Professor Calder√≥n, analyzing data from the
								Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven Nation Laboratory. Our goal was to understand the
								formation of the universe in the first moments after the big bang. We simulated those
								extreme conditions with high energy heavy ion collisions, meaning gold ion slamming
								together near the spped of light. By tracking the trajectories of the resulting
								particles, we could infer their mass, charge, and some properties of their behavior.
							</p>
							<p>
								Particles are accelerated to the required energy levels, at which point
								they are diverted into colliding trajectories. When ions collide, they explode
								outward, generating an assortment of secondary particles. STAR (the Solenoidal Tracker
								At Rhic) is the particle tracker that allows us to record the trajectories of these
								particles. As the particles explode outward, they are subjected to very powerful
								electromagnetic fields which bend the particles into helical trajectories. The amount and direction
								of curvature tells us about the charge and mass of the particles.

								My main contribution was writing classes in C++ to standardize the computational geometry
								used to understand these particle trajectories. I wrote a helix class, and used it to
								refine the geometry of particle detection. I mostly did this by ensuring that all
								trajectories went through the beam path, and the centered on the same collision point.
