							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>
								Intuitive Surgical makes the da Vinci Surgical Robot. This robot enables surgical procedures
								to be performed with minimally invasive procedures, giving a doctor improved precision
								and control, and improving patient outcomes and recover time.
							</p>
							<p>
								I worked there for 8 years, contributing to the Automation, Equipment & Test Team (AET)
								for instruments and accessories. During my tenure, I took on roles as both a software
								engineer and as a manager to the software engineering team. Much of my work is focused
								on manufacturing tools, and remains trade secrets, so I'll be discussing my work in
								broader terms, as they relate to publicly released products.</p>

							<h2>Individual Contributions</h2>
							<!--<img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/pR2OJRFTr4Bevycser8udgOOIJUKzUnCx9hefwUnJH4.jpg?auto=webp&s=021b661bdd259278254a2a183571a51d5919e0b4" width="50%"/>-->
							<p>I was a key contributor to Intuitive's automation boom, driving towards higher quality
								standards or more lower cost medical instruments. I automated tasks that were repetitive,
								ergonomically challenging, and sometimes dangerous for operators to perform.
								I also took on tasks that improved product quality beyond the precision that human
								technicians of reliably capable of. This is particularly important in medical instruments,
								since this guarantees the products will perform safely and reliably.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was never the fastest developer, but I thrived on tasks that were particularly
								difficult and open-ended. These were areas were I could find inventive solutions,
								exceed expectations, and create elegant, extensible, and generalizable solutions.
								There is a patent pending, and if/when it is released, I can added detailed examples.</p>

							<p>
								I worked with the Instruments and accessories teams. From a technical standpoint, this meant
								focusing on control of specific robotic joints relevant to the instruments, as well
								as numerous robotics integration tasks. From a hardware manufacturing standpoint, this
								meant producing product of moderate complexity at mid to high volume (1-10 million
								units / year). My individual contributions were mostly to the following Da Vinci Xi lines:
								<ul>
									<li>8mm instrument base instrument production lines (all 24 of them). I was a key
										contributor/creator on all aspects of these lines.</li>
									<li>I helped improve key test fixtures for our most complex instrument lines, the
										Xi staplers (30/45/60, curved tip 30/45/60).</li>
									<li>Suction irrigator: I helped develop fixtures and test equipment for this line.</li>
									<li>12mm and Stapler Seals (These are the highest volume parts we produced), introducing
										an interesting new set of challenges, centered around automation and very fast
										takt times. I helped select components, and design the software architecture
										to allow all the components to be smoothly integrated.</li>
									<li>Vessel Sealer/ SynchroSeal welding and weld analysis tools.</li>
									<li>Harmonic Ace line improvements and support.</li>
									<li>Global Labeling Management System: A data management initiative, inspired by
									legislation around the way product labeling are managed on single use and multi-use
									medical devices.</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Leadership</h2>
							<h3>Philosophy</h3>
							<p> A good leader protects and empowers their team. It's not about getting every ounce out
								of them. It's about giving them the opportunity and the vision to strive for their
								best. To do this, a good leader builds a fault-tolerant systems, in which
								people aren't afraid to make mistakes or ask questions.
								"There's nothing you can break that I can't fix." - Simon Sinek</p>
							<h3>Practical Experience</h3>
							<p>
								In a leadership capacity, I balanced competing schedules and priorities, allowing my
								team members to focus on development. I felt it was my role to isolate them from most
								of that noise, presenting realistic internal goals and priorities. These focused largely on daily production needs. However, the company was in a growth phase, and we also had
								plenty of opportunities for improvement to our processes and code base. I focused on:
								<ul>
									<li>Architectural improvements to our code-base, to remove code duplication and
									dependencies on less stable tools.</li>
									<li>Process improvements: Moving from SVN to git, making code reviews more rigorous,
										and working towards continuous integration.</li>
									<li>Improvements in test coverage.</li>
									<li>Knowledge transfer: Standardization of how we documented complex systems,
										trained new team members, and kept current team members informed about relevant
										improvements to the code-base.</li>
								</ul>
								Finally, since this was a job in med-tech, there was a very significant amount of
								documentation overhead. I read, wrote, and signed many FDA protocols in my time with
								Intuitive, and also put a lot of time and into streamlining our document efforts
