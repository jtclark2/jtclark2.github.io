#Who's this for?
ME - Trevor
It's really just a TODO list, so it's going to be boring for anyone else!

# Next Steps
- Stub pics/videos for key projects (stub them all before you start trying to find/generate the content)
    - Card Shark
    - maybe autoEncoder (it's a good start, but I can flush it out a bit more)
    - <strike>Facial Keypoints</strike>
    - <strike>CRISM</strike>
- Find pics/videos for all the stubs
    - list of images/videos is growing...should I leave in images/ or start sub-dividing?
- Proofread everything
- Fill out remaining projects 
    - (medium priority - already generated core content)
        - Mars/Crism
        - Facial Keypoints
    - (low priority - fix what you have first)
        - Luidia (a few project ideas are stubbed on this page already)
        - Intuitive (a few project ideas are stubbed on this page already)
        - Hobbies
        - Adding any more content to existing project pages
        - Wakeboard
        - Wakeboarding rack
- Add Sections:
    - Personal / About Me section
    - Add School (I found a bunch of old project files)
    - Add Work History Section (Luidia / Inutitive / SETI | possibly RHIC, solar energy commission, Davis, Stanford)
