							<h2>What is Card Shark?</h2>
							<p>Card Shark is an computer vision program that recognizes card and highlights the optimal
								moves to play. In particular, it's the world's best SET player!</p>

							<p>
								Set is a card game in which 12 cards are laid out, and each player has to pick out sets of 3 cards that follow specific
								patterns. Each card is identified by combination of 4 features: shape, color, and fill, and count. A set is formed,
								when each feature is either the same across all three cards, or unqiue across all three cards.
							</p>

							<h2>How it works?</h2>
							<p>
								<ol>
								<li>The application captures a frame, either from a saved image or live video from a webcam.</li>
								<li>The frames is searched for contours, and then the collection of contours is searched for card-like shapes, based on size/shape/etc.</li>
								<li>Each Card is then projected into a standard rectangle of known dimensions.</li>
								<li>The card is then analyzed to determine all of the card's attributes: [Shape, Color, Count, Fill] And Card objects are created to match each of the card images.</li>
								<li>The rules of set are applied, finding all showing sets.</li>
								<li>Graphics overlays are generated, outline all identified cards, with text to show the attributes.</li>
								<li>Finally, one of the sets is selected and highlighted with another color. </li>
								</ol>

								The program processes each frame by first finding contours and filtering for any that could
								be card-shaped.
