							<h2>What is Card Shark?</h2>
							<p>Card Shark is a computer vision program that recognizes card and highlights the optimal
								moves to play. In particular, it's the world's best SET player!</p>
							<h2>What is SET?</h2>
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NzXDfSFQ1c0"

							<p>
								Set is a card game in which 12 cards are laid out, and each player has to pick out sets of 3 cards that follow specific
								patterns. Each card is identified by combination of 4 features: shape, color, and fill, and count. A set is formed,
								when each feature is either the same across all three cards, or unqiue across all three cards.
							</p>

							<h2>How the application works?</h2>
							<p>
								<ol>
									<li>The application captures a frame, either from file or live video.</li>
									<span><img src="images/Capture_AllShades.jpg" alt="pic of raw frame (small)" width="25%"/></span>
									<li>The frame is pre-processed to filter out major variations in brightness/lighting.
										This flattens the image so that we can use a single threshold over the entire image
										in the next step, rather than a dynamic threshold, which is far less likely to
										form continuous borders, and create consistently closed curves for contour generation.</li>
									<span><img src="images/PreCorrection.jpg" alt="Pic of original image" width="25%"/></span> -
									<span><img src="images/LightCorrection.jpg" alt="Pic of background subtract (big bowl)" width="25%"/></span> =
									<span><img src="images/PostCorrection.jpg" alt="corrected image" width="25%"/></span>
									<li>The frame is thresholded using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method">Otsu's method</a>,
										leaving us with a binary image showing the shapes of objects in the image. We
										isolate the borders of these shapes, extracting them as contours. Then we filter
										the borders/contours, keeping only the ones that are the shape and size of cards.
										Basically, we check if the contour can be approximated well with exactly 4 points,
										and check if the area of a quadrilateral formed by those 4 points is similar
										to the area of the full contour. There of a few more checks related to size and
										aspect ratio as well.
									</li>
									<span><img src="images/card_contour_thresh.jpg" alt="thresh image" width="50%"/></span>
									<li>Each Card is processed to determine it's attributes:
											<span><img src="images/IsolatedCardsPlot.JPG" alt="Isolated Cards Plot" width="50%"/></span>
										<ol>
											<li>Corners of card are extracted from contour, and used to project the card into a rectangle of standardized dimensions.</li>
											<li>The cards are pre-processed, converting to grayscale, blurring to reduce noise, and subtracting variation in background brightness.</li>
											<li>Thresholding is performed, generate a contours.</li>
											<span><img src="images/CardBasicMask.JPG" alt="Isolated Cards Plot" width="50%"/></span>
											<li><b>Shape and Count</b>:
													<ul>
														<li>Method 1: The contours are used to generate masks of the contour
															silhouette. This silhouette is compared to previously recorded
															templates of each shape/count combination, using intersection over union.
															This method works quite well, and generalizes nicely to any deck of cards.
															It works 99.9% of the time, but it is a bit sensitive to translation
															(shifts in x and y). If the card's region of interest is not perfectly
															centered, misidentification can occur.
														</li>
															<span><img src="images/Intersection.JPG" alt="intersection" width="25%"/></span>
															<span><img src="images/Union.JPG" alt="union" width="25%"/></span>
															<span><img src="images/IntersectionOverUnion.JPG" alt="IntersectionOverUnion" width="25%"/></span>

														<li>Method 2: In order to overcome the translation invariance, I wrote detectors
															specific to the shapes used in SET. These detectors calculate
															the area of the shape, and then compare it to the areas of shapes
															generated with convex hulls and bounding rectangles. Different shapes
															very reliably generate different ratios of area, and I've utilized
															that as a metric to identify particular shapes.</li>
															<span><img src="images/ConvexHull_BoundingBox.JPG" alt="shape with overlaid convex hull/ bounding box" width="25%"/></span>

													</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The silhouettes from the previous step are treated as mask, and erode operations
											are used with some bitwise operations to generate masks that isolate the edges
												of shapes, the interior fill of shapes, and the background of the card.</li>
											<li>A copy of the image is converted into HSV space.</li>
											<li><b>Color</b>:The HSV image is masked to isolate the edge of the shape. The hue is calculated
												over the mask to find the closest color match.</li>
												<span><img src="images/EdgeMask.JPG" alt="masked edge" width="25%"/></span>
												<span><img src="images/EdgeMaskSaturated.JPG" alt="masked edge, saturated" width="25%"/></span>
											<li><b>Fill/Texture</b>: A mask is used to calculate average saturation. However, it's fairly
												sensitive to lighting, so we normalize by the average saturation of the background.
												I had started by looking for stripes, but low quality webcams struggle to focus,
												so saturation proved more robust to changes in camera/lighting.</li>
											<span><img src="images/FillMask.JPG" alt="Masked fill" width="25%"/></span>
											<span><img src="images/BackgroundMask.JPG" alt="Masked background" width="25%"/></span>
												<!--Why don't we take a ratio with the edge...that would vary with focus/lighting
												just as much, and the solid fill will scale with lighting/focus, giving us a better
												sense of the values...-->
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>The rules of set are applied, finding all sets.</li>
									<li>Graphics overlays are generated to show outline contours, cards, and sets,
										as well as overlaying text to show the identified attributes. A key and fps
										indicator are shown as well.</li>
									<span><img src="images/Processed_WithOverlay.JPG" alt="Full output image with overlays" width="50%"/></span>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<p>
								The main challenge in this project was dealing with poor image quality (cheap cameras),
								variations in lighting, or uneven lighting.
								<ul>
									<li>The purple used on these cards is the least saturated, making it difficult to detect,
								particularly in bright/over-saturated conditions, where the striped purple becomes very close to a
								light gray.</li>
									<li>Realistically lighting brightness and source changes quite a bit. The colors of cards
								are influenced by the source, and needed to be color-balanced. Outside light is great,
								as long as it's not too bright. Room lights are more yellow than natural light,
								while iphones and computer screens are much more blue.</li>
									<li>Variations in intensity throughout an image make thresholding challenging,
									needing to be isolated and corrected.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>
								I wrote this application to be as robust as possible, but in extreme situations, it
								makes sense to recalibrate (eg: if you're playing outside, or in a room with the lights
								off and just the glow of a tv screen). For these situations, there are a handful of
								routines you can run with keyboard inputs. For the most part, just press 'c' to
								calibrate colors, and use '[' and ']' to adjust the saturation threshold. There are a
								number of additional features (saving, pausing, quitting, more manual calibrations, etc.)
								which can be found in KeyboardInput.py, but I don't anticipate most users needed those.
								I included them mostly for development purposes.
