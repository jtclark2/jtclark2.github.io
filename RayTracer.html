							<h2>What is a Ray Tracer?</h2>
							<p>A Ray Tracer simulates a world/scene, particular the physics of the light rays that bounce
								around the scene, hitting any object that populate that world. This considers how light
								bounces/transmits/scatters off of these objects, and how it gets focused onto a camera/sensor
								to eventually be turned into an image.
							</p>

							<h2>Key Features:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Positionable Camera</b></li>
								<li><b>Defocus Blur (Depth of Field)</b>: notice how objects very close/far away are out of focus (that's intentional)</li>
								<li><b>Anti-aliasing</b>: Helps objects look more realistic (avoiding that jagged pixelated images.</li>
								<li><b>Materials</b>: Determing how light behaves when hitting the surface<ul>
										<li><b>Diffuse Materials</b>: Any non-reflective material, that scatters light in all directions</li>
										<li><b>Metals (Reflective)</b>: Bounces in a particular direction, like it would off of a mirror</li>
										<li><b>Dielectric (Transparent, like glass)</b>: Goes through material, based on ratio of indexes of refraction.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>What was the purpose of this project?</h2>
							<p>The project itself is exciting for me. I've build simple 2D game engines before, but 3D
								graphics is very new territory. It opens up a new world of tools, and it's very compelling visually.
								My Fiancee is a 3D artist as well, so I'm always hearing about these concepts, and now I finally understand them!</p>
							<p>This project also immersed me in C++, building experience with the language, and particularly with
								a mindset of writing highly efficient/optimized code. This project does not use any
								external libraries. All the math behind the rays is handling within this repo.</p>
